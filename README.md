## Notes

One of the main challenges I faced while building the app was setting up version control with Git and pushing my code to a new GitHub repository. Since my project was already initialized with Git, I ran into conflicts with the remote repositoryâ€™s history and had to learn how to resolve them through merging and force-pushing. I also encountered hurdles when integrating new features and ensuring the UI looked as intended, which required troubleshooting, testing, and refining my code. These challenges ultimately improved my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of the development process.
